An ideal destination for nature lovers In Mawsynram, there is a cave called the Mawjymbuin Cave which is one of the well known caves in Meghalaya. This cave, due to years of weathering and due to dripping of mineralized solutions and deposition of calcium carbonate, it has thus given rise to some magnificent stalagmites. These stalagmites are not only important and of great interest for geological research but also because of their exquisiteness.

Sri Aurobindo Ashram: The Sri Aurobindo Ashram located on rue de la Marine, is one of the most well-known ashrams in India. The ashram was set up in 1926 by one of India’s famous sons Sri Aurobindo, who originally came to Pondicherry to escape persecution by the British. Sri Aurobindo, a saint-yogi, philosopher-poet, taught Integral Yoga, a new system of mind development, a synthesis of yoga and modern science. Madame Mirra Richard Alfassa, a French painter-sculptor-musician who had followed the same path on her own, joined him later. She is now known as the Mother. After the death of Sri Aurobindo, 'the Mother' continued the social work till she died in 1973 at the age of 93. The idea of Auroville or the 'City of Down' was conceived by 'The Mother'. The Pondicherry Museum: The Pondicherry Museum is located on Saint Louis street and is open between 10.00-17.00 hrs on all days except Mondays and national holidays. The museum is located in the former residence of the French Administrator.

Surrounded by the Kaveri water is a 600 acre island town enclosed within the seven walls on the gigantic Sri Ranganathaswamy temple. There are no less than 22 gopurams, one of which is the tallest in India. The 72 m high 13 tiered Gopuram dominates the landscape for miles around. Also visit the Rock Fort: Tirchy's most famous landmark is 83 mt high rock which is the only outcrop in the otherwise flat inland of the city. The most amazing fact about the rock is that it is one of the oldest in the world. The sheer abruptness of its rise is an attention grabber. But the actual centre of attraction is not the fort itself, of which very little remains, but the temple at the summit. Later in the afternoon drive to Madurai. Upon arrival check into the hotel.

It was built in honor of Guru Nanak Dev ji and is tucked away deep in the Himalayas. After four more kilometers of driving, we arrived at Magnetic Hill, which defies gravity. A well-known confluence of two rivers can be seen as you continue past Magnetic Hills, just before Nimmu Village. The Indus River originates in Tibet (left), while the Zanskar River originates in Zanskar Valley (right). We travel to Alchi Gompa after seeing Confluence. This village's temple complex, which dates back to the 11th century, is the most renowned of Ladakh's monasteries. We returned to Leh after our visit to Alchi, stopping along the way to see the 25-foot Lord gold-covered Buddha statue at Likir Monastery, which was constructed in the eleventh century and rebuilt in the eighteenth.
